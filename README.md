# Pranayama Desktop Pygame Prototype

**About:** this is a simple one-day project about special breath technique called Pranayama. It is inspired by [iOS Pranayama App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/health-through-breath-pranayama/id341935130?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4) by Saagara which we use on the diver's course. It also follows the same concept in design.

**Motivation**: firstly, I planned to create free customizable pranayama application for myself training, and, secondly, try to use [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/hifi.html) package and know a bit more about it's features.    

**Troubles:** 

1. of course lots of questions come from lack of knowledge about pygame
2. it is really surprisingly that I can't found simple way to create input data form in UI
3. a lot of pain comes from efforts to find suitable sound accompaniment. It was unexpectedly that it was so hard to find music across many massive sample bases. Finally, I gave up and made sounds by my own.
4. because of artificial time limitation the result is more like proof-of-concept with many imperfections in code, design and sound effects, but at last it works as I thought

**How to use**:
- run pranayama.py script (need to install pygame with dependencies).
- you need to input five numbers - duration of inhale phase, first pause in breathing, exhale phase, second pause and total number of iterations. Then you may close your eyes and breathe according with music or breathe looking at stages progressbar. You may learn how long every stage is and how breathe properly from trial saagara version or from any online-manual (like [this] (http://blog.yogasynergy.com/2015/10/breathing-part-2-passive-seated-pranayama-generate-internal-energy-by-doing-less-than-nothing/)).
